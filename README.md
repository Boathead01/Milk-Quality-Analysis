# Milk-Quality-Analysis

# Milk Quality Monitoring System using Raspberry Pi, pH & Temperature Sensors, and KMeans Clustering

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project aims to assess milk quality by measuring **pH** and **temperature** using:

- **SEN0161 pH sensor**
- **DS18B20 Temperature Sensor**

These sensors are interfaced with a **Raspberry Pi**, and the collected data is calibrated and used to classify the milk's quality using a **KMeans clustering model**.
